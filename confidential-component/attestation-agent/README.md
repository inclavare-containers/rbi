# Reproducible Build Attestation-agent

This project is based on Docker for reproducible build, and currently supports running on Ubuntu 22.04 platform. The AA source code is located at [guest-components/attestation-agent at 917097b5dbd61078af037e5411f0760d47981640 Â· confidential-containers/guest-components (github.com)](https://github.com/confidential-containers/guest-components/tree/917097b5dbd61078af037e5411f0760d47981640/attestation-agent). The construction of Docker containers draws inspiration from the implementation in [inclavare-containers/docker-attestation-agent (github.com)](https://github.com/inclavare-containers/docker-attestation-agent).
